Project Title: Oscar Awards Historical Analysis (1928â€“2025)

Description:
This project explores the Oscar Awards dataset from 1928 to 2025 with a focus on uncovering historical trends, demographic patterns, and disparities across categories. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and build visualizations that highlight insights such as:

Gender distribution among Best Director winners

Frequency and timing of female wins across decades

Age distribution of nominees and winners

Most awarded individuals and films

Changes in categories over time

The goal is to analyze not only who wins, but also what these patterns tell us about the evolution of the film industry through the lens of the Oscars.
